This is for companies to see what work/research I have completed.
This repository showcases my applied geoscience and computational research work integrating Python, GIS, and machine learning for subsurface and geophysical analysis.

Key areas of work include:

Seismic data processing (reflection/refraction imaging, P- & S-wave velocity modeling)

Hydrogeologic modeling using ERT, GPR, and seismic methods (Pondicherry aquifer project)

Geophysical property mapping in ArcGIS & Python (EarthScope & USGS grids)

Automated stock data analysis using APIs, SQL, and vectorized trend modeling

Java backend development with Spring Boot and JDBC for data management

Participation in EarthScope SAGE/GAGE programs, including the Seismology Workshop and GNSS Gambit (ground deformation analysis using GNSS data).

This portfolio is designed for companies and researchers to review the technical breadth and interdisciplinary scope of my geoscience and data-driven projects.
